# memorify
simple name logger for me to remember cli apps that i thought ppl would like

## build:
```
  sudo pacman -S pyinstaller
  pyinstaller --onefile memorify.py
```
(pyinstaller is most likely in your distro's package manager as well)

## install:
```
  sudo mv dist/memorify /usr/local/bin/
```

## usage:
```
  memorify                  -  show list
  memorify --help           -  show args
```

### todo:
```

```
